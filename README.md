polymer-filters
================

A collection of Polymer filters for formatting values of expressions for display to users

This fork is modified from the original to simply strip all references to polymer as a dependency in the build system and the html. You must inject polymer yourself at the application root layer in order for this component to work within your application.

See the [component page](http://addyosmani.github.io/polymer-filters) for more information.
